The platform user interface has three main parts:
1. Reporting: victims can report their experience and hsare with others. This reports are aggregated and later used to provide overall scores for organizations. Organizations can be companies, universities, etc. 

2. Sharing/ Mentoring/finding helpful voice: After reporting the victims can choose to share their detailed expereince with others, he or she can choose to select members of their own organizations only or to everyone. The default is only among their same organizations/ members who identify to be from teh same organizations.

3. A details/ researched aggregated overview dashboard: we collect the anonymized data from the reports and create an overall aggregated dashboard to give people an overall picture of our work environment, when it comes to gender-based misconduct and sexual harassment. The dashboard has several components:
- a tag cloud showing the most common words appearing in teh reports/stories. 
- a stat in a pie chart showing who is usually responsible for the miscondust or harassment. This helps people/organization to understand where to focus their energy when it comes to mitigate the problem. 
- a bar chart shwoing if the HR/ authority is helpful enough to the victims. A score of 1 means not helpful 7 means very helpful. 
- Next we show all the reports grouped by different organizations. We have used random names for imaginary organizations. 
- A timeline view shows when the reports were filed, so we can at least see the accumulation of the reports, we also see that there is a pause of reports, may be at that time there were some social anti-harassment movement was hoing on and harassers were more cautious.
- We also show a total reports by each organizations. 


** The Reporting Form:
*** Security/Privacy: Combined stat available for all, detailed comment only for the reporter. If the reporter seeks guidance he/she can choose to share their story with others from teh same organiztion. We did not implement the full access control for the hackathon, but the idea is it will be a safe space for people, they will get mental support, advice, learn about others' experience, and get string.
